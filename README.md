# Introduction
Buying a house is a nerve-racking process, there are millions of variables to take into consideration and people usually leave the decision to their gut feeling.
Things can be different, data science can show people what are the different factors that make a neighbourhood so popular and on-demand and they can decide whether a certain factor is important for them or not.

This project has for objective to analyse Montreal hosing market and identify key elements and factors that increase the value of a given neighbourhood and ultimately the value of a property.

# Data
For this study, I will use housing prices from Montreal's biggest real estate database and use Foursquare to get all the geo-location information about the venues in the neighbourhoods to study.
